                Magic: The Gathering, as explained by Tolarian Community College, is a strategic card game
                where
                players take on the roles of Planeswalkers, powerful wizards with the ability to summon
                creatures, cast
                spells, and harness the energies of the Multiverse. Players use decks comprised of various
                card types,
                including Lands (for mana), Creatures, Instants, Sorceries, Artifacts, Enchantments, and
                Planeswalkers,
                to defeat their opponents. The game combines elements of strategy, resource management, and
                tactical
                play, with each card type offering unique abilities and roles within the player's deck.
            </p>
            <p class="video-text-down">
                The basic gameplay involves players drawing cards from their decks, playing Land cards for mana, and
                using that mana to cast spells or summon creatures. Players alternate turns, during which they can
                attack their opponent and use their cards' abilities to gain an advantage. The goal is to reduce the
                opponent's life points to zero through strategic play and clever use of card combinations. Magic:
                The Gathering's depth, variety of strategies, and expansive universe make it both a challenging and
                rewarding experience for players.

                    <h3>What is a spell?</h3>
                    <p>In the world of Magic: The Gathering, a 'spell' is pretty much any card you play. Most of the
                        time, you'll be casting spells straight from your hand. But here's a cool twist - sometimes,
                        you
                        can cast spells from other places, like your library or graveyard. Just remember, land cards
                        are
                        the exception; they're not counted as spells.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-8 col-12 order-2">
                    <h3>Creatures</h3>
                    <p> Creature cards are your main buddies in Magic: The Gathering. Think of them as your personal
                        squad for attacking, defending, and pulling off cool abilities when it's your turn. These
                        creatures are a diverse bunch – they come in all sorts of shapes and strengths. The damage
                        they
                        deal or take depends on their size and power, and their special abilities can vary a lot
                        based
                        on their color, cost, and the unique character they represent.</p>
                    <p> Now, here's a key rule: when you play a creature card, it can't attack right away. This is
                        called 'summoning sickness.' You've got to wait a turn before they're ready to rumble. You
                        use
                        your creatures to either launch attacks on your opponents or block their attacking
                        creatures.

                <div class="col-lg-8 col-12 order-2">
                    <h3>Artifacts</h3>
                    <p> Artifacts are like your secret weapons. Think of them as all sorts of cool gadgets, gear,
                        and
                        magical items that give you an upper hand in the game. They're packed with neat abilities to
                        spice up your gameplay.</p>
                    <p> These nifty cards can do all sorts of helpful things, like giving you more mana to play with,
                        letting you draw extra cards, or opening up new, clever ways to play on the battlefield. The
                        best part? Most artifacts aren't picky about colors, so they can fit in seamlessly with any deck
                        you build. They're like the Swiss Army knives of your Magic toolkit!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Enchantments</h3>
                    <p> Enchantment cards are like your secret spells that can totally shake up the game. They can
                        mess
                        with your opponent's plans, shield your own stuff, or even change the rules of the game a
                        bit.
                        When you play an enchantment, it hangs out on the battlefield unless someone zaps it away or
                        destroys it.</p>
                    <p> What's cool about enchantments is they keep working their magic as long as they're in play.
                        They
                        can pump up your creatures, give them awesome abilities like flying, and do a bunch of other
                        neat tricks. Just like artifacts and creatures, enchantments stick around after you cast
                        them,
                        unless your opponent manages to take them out.

                    <h3>Sorceries</h3>
                    <p> Sorcery cards are like your big, dramatic spells that make a splash and then vanish. They're
                        perfect for throwing a wrench in your opponent's plans or giving your game a serious boost.
                        Unlike other cards, sorceries don't hang around on the battlefield. Once you cast them and
                        their
                        cool effects happen, they head straight to the graveyard.</p>
                    <p> You can use sorceries for all sorts of stuff: dealing damage, creating new creature tokens,
                        wiping out your opponent's creatures, and loads more. Just remember, you can only play these
                        show-stoppers during the Main Phases of your turn, so timing is everything!</p>

                    <h3>Instants</h3>
                    <p> Instant cards are like your secret tricks up your sleeve. They're quick, one-off effects
                        that
                        can really shake things up. You can use them to zap something with damage or sneak a peek at
                        cards in your library. The coolest part? You can play instants on your turn or even during
                        your
                        opponent's turn – surprise!</p>
                    <p> Just like sorceries, instants don't stick around on the battlefield. Once you've played them
                        and
                        their awesome effects kick in, they go straight to the graveyard. Instants are perfect for
                        giving your game a sudden boost or turning the tide of a battle when your opponent least
                        expects
                        it.</p>

                    <h3>Planeswalkers</h3>
                    <p> Planeswalker cards are like the superheroes of the game. They're powerful allies that can
                        really
                        change how your game unfolds. These cards come with cool abilities you can use again and
                        again,
                        like drawing extra cards, boosting your life points, or even wiping out your opponent's
                        creatures.</p>
                    <p> When a planeswalker shows up on the battlefield, they bring along 'loyalty counters' (you'll
                        see
                        the number on the bottom right of the card). Using their abilities means playing around with
                        these counters, either adding or taking them away. But remember, you can only use one of
                        their
                        abilities per turn, and only during your main phase.</p>

                    <h3>Lands</h3>
                    <p> Think of land cards in Magic: The Gathering as your game's backbone. They're like different
                        places from the Multiverse – think mystical forests, towering mountains, or deep, dark
                        swamps.
                        These lands are super important because they generate mana, the magic juice you need to cast
                        spells and use abilities.</p>
                    <p> Here’s how it works: during your turn, you can play one land card. It's usually smart to do
                        this
                        during your main phase, and ideally before you start slinging spells. These lands are your
                        mana
                        factories. You 'tap' them (turn them sideways) to get mana, which is like your magical
                        currency
                        for casting spells.</p>
